Now, researchers in Oak Ridge National Laboratory in eastern Tennessee are trying to find out whether or not parallel universes exist - by attempting to open a portal into one.According to NBC News, physicist Leah Broussard will conduct a series of experiments by firing a beam of neutrons through a 50-foot tunnel. At the end of the tunnel, the particles will hit an impenetrable wall. A neutron detector will be set up on the other end of the wall.If the setup is right, some of those particles will transform into mirror-image versions of themselves, passing through the wall. If the neutron detector detects a neutron, it could prove the existence of a parallel dimension.\"It's pretty wacky,\" Ms Broussard tells NBC News.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"adslotNativeVideo\"); });But if you are expecting to find a mirror version of yourself in the parallel universe, that probably won't happen.
