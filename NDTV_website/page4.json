Take a look at some of the posts here:View this post on InstagramNew dads & loved ones listen up! Its World Breast feeding week and this post is for you to know that you can be the biggest support and encouragement to a new mom! A mother may be depressed, lacking in confidence, worried, or stressed and it affects breastfeeding. These factors do not directly affect her milk production, but can interfere with the way in which she responds to her baby. This can result in the baby taking less milk, and failing to stimulate milk production. So be there for her . Understanding the pressure on her physically and emotionally is the best thing you can do. Nothing like feeling loved at such an overwhelming time. . I would also like to give a shoutout to moms who have struggled with low milk production . This could happen due to a pathological reason including endocrine problems or a host of other factors .A few mothers have a physiological low breast-milk production, for no apparent reason, and production does not increase when the breastfeeding technique and pattern improve. There is no reason to shame them or make them feel any pressure in not being able to BF. we need to support all mothers and show love and respect . . #worldbreastfeedingweek2019 . @WABA_global @who @unicefindiaA post shared by  Sameera Reddy (@reddysameera) on Aug 2, 2019 at 12:46am PDTgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"adslotNativeVideo\"); });Sameera Reddy, welcomed her daughter last month, announced her daughter's name on social media in the most adorable way possible.
